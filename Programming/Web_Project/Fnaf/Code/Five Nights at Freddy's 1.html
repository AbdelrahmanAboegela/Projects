            <p>
                Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game and the first installment of the series developed by Scott Cawthon. It was first released on IndieDB as a demo on July 24, 2014, before the full game was released on August 8, 2014 (although it was ultimately removed at an unknown date), and released on Steam on August 18, 2014. The goal for the player is to survive five nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza while avoiding getting caught and stuffed into a mascot costume, thus getting killed by the animatronic characters; this is done by tracking their movements via the restaurant's security cameras.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chronologically, the game is the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 2 and the prequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 3, which makes it the third game of the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to its universal success upon release, the game spawned a media franchise for a series of games, books, and merch, as well as a film adaptation which was released on October 27, 2023.

            <h2 style="color: #ff4500; font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;">Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night, however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.
            </p>
            <p>
                From your small office, you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!
            </p>
            <p>
                Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: #ff4500; font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie point-and-click survival horror game. The player controls Mike Schmidt, the night guard at the fictional Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. The objective of the game is to survive a whole shift, which lasts from midnight to 6 AM (several minutes in real-time) while avoiding the four animatronics who roam the restaurant after hours. Mike is forced to spend each night in the security office, which serves as a base of operations. The player has a Monitor to their disposal to scroll through the security cameras and see where the animatronics are, although the cameras are grainy and poorly lit, and the camera in the Kitchen only provides an audio feed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The animatronics each have unique movement patterns and will attempt to get inside the Office through one of two hallways on either side of the room. The player can activate Hall Lights to check if an animatronic is outside and shut either of the two Doors to keep animatronics out. However, the player has limited Power each night, which is displayed via a percentage in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Power will drain over time, although using the Monitor, lights, and doors will consume more power. If the player runs out, all of these features will deactivate for the rest of the night. Freddy himself will then appear in the Office, eventually attacking unless the clock hits 6 AM first. If an animatronic does enter your office, it results in them jumpscaring the player and taking you to the Game Over screen before we are brought back to the title screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game's main campaign is split into five increasingly difficult levels, or "nights." Finishing Night 5 will complete the story and unlock an extra-challenging Night 6, and clearing that will unlock a customizable Night 7 that allows the player to adjust each animatronics' difficulty.
